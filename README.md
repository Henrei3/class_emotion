# class_emotion

**This is a copy of the work done on emotion classification.**

Its purpose is to showcase the work completed and, for those curious enough, to provide an understanding of the process.

Here, you will find the emodb folder, which contains the entire corpus.
From this corpus, we extract the necessary information into the files emodb_test.csv and emodb_train.csv, respectively.

All the steps taken to apply the Naive Bayes method for classifying emotions in this speech corpus are detailed in this Jupyter notebook.

Enjoy!
